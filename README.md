- Author: Sarah Glass for Python 401

- Collaborated with Anthony, Dan, Logan, and Andrew at a Remo table.

## Overview

- Python has many elegant features that can show the difference between a “programmer who uses Python” and a true “Pythonista”

- Pythonista may be a silly word but it’s a real thing. A true pythonista is able to leverage the particular features of Python to accomplish a task in a simpler and more easy to reason about way.


## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Create examples demonstrating pythonic language features. For example…
- Use iterators/generators on a custom collection to…
- add ability to be used in a for in loop
- add ability to be used in a list comprehension
- add ability to convert to a list or other collection type

- Create a decorator that adds behavior to a given function. For example…
- Calculate the time spent in the function
- Log relevant info for debugging purposes
- Slow down the function
- Convert the return value in some way
- Validate some condition on the way in

- Use dunder methods make your code more readable and elegant. For example…
- add ability for two custom data structure to be considered equal
- add ability for custom data structure to be considered truthy/falsy

- Anything else that catches your interest-
